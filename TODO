MOVE LINES DOWN TO "DONE" AS THINGS ARE IMPLEMENTED ...

MIR
- Missing values (e.g. wave field). To get a wave field: retrieve,stream=wave,param=swh,target=wave.grib
- Rotated fields
- Vo/D to U/V
- Rotated winds?
- Make sure we don't need to cast constness away

TESTING:
- Test mir_tool with valgrind

EMOSLIB
- Find out about all intuv* functions

* Behaviour to reproduce
  - Specifying AREA on a SH field is ignored

ECKIT
- ?

IN TRANS
- Check if tansi can be called with a regular gaussian as output
- Get transi to print an erro if memory allocation fails

PRODGEN:
- ?

MARS:
- Is intermediate_gaussian reduced?
