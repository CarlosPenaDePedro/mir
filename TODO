MOVE LINES DOWN TO "DONE" AS THINGS ARE IMPLEMENTED ...

PRIORITY

 - Create a Tesselation interface, with multiple implementations (Delaunay, ReducedGrid, etc)
   CacheMesh should take tesselation method into account
 - MIR: create unit test framework
 - MIR: Missing values (e.g. wave field). To get a wave field: retrieve,stream=wave,param=swh,target=wave.grib
 - Find out in libemos:
    * sh to rot latlon - what is the path?
    * how 10m uv grid point - how are they interpolate, intvec?

MIR

- Field using LSM. Talk to me on how to get to the LSM data (e.g. with config, and what class do we need to implement)
- Rotated fields (code is there, needs testing)
- Rotated winds?
- Make sure we don't need to cast constness away
- Make sure cached weight files are not loaded for every field
- Wind interpolation
- Use VOD2UV from trans

TESTING:
- Test mir_tool with valgrind

EMOSLIB
- Find out about all intuv* functions

* Behaviour to reproduce
  - Specifying AREA on a SH field is ignored

ECKIT
- Implement general purpose file caching class

IN ATLAS:
- Make sure cached mesh files are not loaded for every field
- Speed-up mesh loading

IN TRANS
- Check if transi can be called with a regular gaussian as output
- Get transi to print an error if memory allocation fails
- sharedmem / memmap for caching transi structures

PRODGEN:
- ?

MARS:
- Is intermediate_gaussian reduced?

DONE:
- Vo/D to U/V: Dropping one coefficient
