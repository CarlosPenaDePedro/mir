MOVE LINES DOWN TO "DONE" AS THINGS ARE IMPLEMENTED ...

PRIORITY

 - Atlas / eckit: Fix mesh caching
 - Atlas: LatLon grid constructor refactor to take Ni Nj

MIR

- Missing values (e.g. wave field). To get a wave field: retrieve,stream=wave,param=swh,target=wave.grib
- Rotated fields
- Rotated winds?
- Make sure we don't need to cast constness away
- Make sure cached weight files are not loaded for every field
- Wind interpolation

TESTING:
- Test mir_tool with valgrind

EMOSLIB
- Find out about all intuv* functions

* Behaviour to reproduce
  - Specifying AREA on a SH field is ignored

ECKIT
- Implement general purpose file caching class

IN ATLAS:
- Make sure cached mesh files are not loaded for every field

IN TRANS
- Check if tansi can be called with a regular gaussian as output
- Get transi to print an erro if memory allocation fails

PRODGEN:
- ?

MARS:
- Is intermediate_gaussian reduced?


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DONE:
- Vo/D to U/V: Dropping one coefficient
