# Problem with ecCodes/2.2.0 handling a reduced_gg with bounding box
# - grid= forces O1280 which is the current HRES, request does not interpolate
# - area= was been simplified from original area=37.6025/-114.891/27.7626/-105.188

# Mars request
param=msl,levtype=sfc,grid=O1280
# Mir tool options
--area=27.9/253/27.8/254
