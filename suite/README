To use the suite please do the following:


1. Initialise ecflow

use ecflow

2. Start the ecflow server.

- Choose which settings file you will be using, e.g. local.settings
- Start an appropriate server for this file with:

./start_server.sh -c local.settings

3. Run the suite

- NB at present if the output folder already exists, new results will be added to what is there.
- To change this behaviour, remove / rename the output folder before executing the following command:

./setup.py -f --config-file=local.settings

(the -f flag causes any pre-existing suites to be overwritten)

4. Watch the suite running

ecflowview

- Browse to the server and port on which ecflow is running.


5. Visualise the results in the web application.
