# intensity: physical quantity whose magnitude is independent of the extent (size) of the system
# - (this is the general case)
# - vector polar magnitude is also intensity
# - vector Cartesian components are also intensities
# - typical units: no
intensity:

# ratio: quotient of quantities of the same kind
# - typical units: <non-dimensional>
ratio:

# rate: ratio between two related quantities (time, mass, length, etc.)
# - typical units: [... s**-1]
rate:
