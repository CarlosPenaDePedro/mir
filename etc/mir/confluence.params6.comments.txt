all fluxes should conservative
avoid interpolation?
clarify?
clarify? concentation
clarify? copernicus
concentration
concentration, global conservative
cover
cover (as per other covers) definitely not bilinear!
difference
difference, may be negative (as in all anomalies)
fail
flux
flux, copernicus
flux?
fraction
fraction (see cloud cover)
fraction/cover clarify? richard forbes
index
intensity
like cloud water
like temperature
ocean?
probability
rate
rate (anomaly)
rate grib should be renamed
ratio
ratio (see albedo)
ratio? clarify?
spectral coefficiencts, truncation possible for interpolation
spectral coefficient
spectral, truncation possible
spectral, could be truncated
this parameter (14021) goes with 140122 to define a vector
unknown?
vector angle, needs review! probably not to interpolate.
wave?

spectral coefficient, n.b. u*cos(lat) returned by emoslib ! we should change the parameter [paul dando]

spectral coefficient, n.b. v*cos(lat) returned by emoslib ! we should change the parameter [paul dando]

the 2D spectra are actually archived in such a way that small values are discarded and encoded as missing data. therefore for a given frequency and direction there will be a certain number of sea points with missing data but they might be different for the next frequency and direction bin

the 2D wave spectra are actually archived as a 2D matrix at each grid point in such a way that small values are discarder and set to missing. it is therefore not possible to use interpolation.
